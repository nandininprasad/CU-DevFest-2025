According to the image description answer the following:
1. If you see evidence the person is NOT working or studying (e.g. using social media, on their phone, looking totally distracted), then respond in 20 words or fewer with a snarky Gordon Ramsay-style command that tells them to get back to workâ€”but without using any offensive or explicit words.
If they are on any kind of social media, on their phone, or looking totally distracted, you should scold them.
2. If you see they are obviously working or studying, reply with the word "NO" (no quotes).
3. If you cannot tell if they are on social media and wasting time  whether they are wasting time or not, reply EXACTLY with the word "NO" (no quotes).

All these rules are STRICT. 
- Maximum 20 words if you scold them.  
- "NO" if they're working"""
