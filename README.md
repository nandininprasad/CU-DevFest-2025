# Matcha Mode: Brew Your Best Self

**Ever tried to study or work, only to find yourself lost in social media rabbit holes or non-stop chats with friends?** Distractions happen to all of us, and pushing through with willpower alone isn’t always enough. That’s why we created **Matcha Mode**—a holistic productivity and mental wellness tool designed to help you stay focused when you need it most and gently guide you to recharge when it’s time to unwind.

## Why Matcha Mode?

We built Matcha Mode for the **Health & Accessibility** track to make focus, mental wellness, and self-awareness a seamless part of daily life. Whether you’re a student, developer, creative, or just doing your best to stay balanced, Matcha Mode is here to support your mental health journey and improve your productivity—without sacrificing your well-being.

## Choose Your Brew

### ☕ Focus Roast
- **Stay on Task** – Block out digital distractions as if you’ve got Gordon Ramsay sternly reminding you to put down your phone.
- **Sharp and Efficient** – Keep your mind locked in on the task at hand with minimal friction.

### 🍵 Tranquili-Tea
- **Dream Journal** – Record your dreams and transform them into AI-generated visuals. Even those bizarre late-night scenarios can offer insights.
- **Vent Space** – Speak openly and honestly without judgment or filters—a safe place to clear your mind.
- **Mood Tracker** – Use audio journals to track focus, stress, and energy. Identify patterns and learn to work *with* your brain, not against it.

**Matcha Mode ensures that you’re not just productive, but also nurturing your mental well-being.**
